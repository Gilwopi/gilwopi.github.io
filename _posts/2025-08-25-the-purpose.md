## The Purpose

I have set out to contribute to this blog with one specific purpose: to explore how Jesus of Nazareth uses rabbinic strategies to infuse his already meaningful teachings with even deeper meaning. These manifest in many ways, and they are found all throughout the Gospels. While some interpretations or theories presented here are new, they are founded on concepts used by Jewish and Christian commentators alike. May this journey push us to a better understanding of who Jesus is and what he envisions for the world.
