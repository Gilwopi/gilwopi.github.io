|:---:|:---:|

| And the Lord said to Moses, "Write <span style='background-color: aliceblue'>these words</span>, for in accodance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel." So he was there with the Lord <span style='background-color: coral'>forty days and forty nights</span>. He neither ate <span style='background-color: fuchsia'>bread</span> nor drank water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Commandments. | And after fasting <span style='background-color: coral'>forty days and nights</span>, he was hungry. And the tempter came and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of <span style='background-color: fuchsia'>bread</span>." But he answered, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by <span style='background-color: aliceblue'>every word</span> that comes from the mouth of God." |
